Design Space Exploration for Compressed Deep Convolutional Neural Network on SCALE Sim

## Project Description:
(Provide a short description of the problem you're addressing)

Quantize Convolutional layer and feedforward layer into low-bit like int8, int4, and int2 and deploy it on the open source platform Systolic CNN AcceLErator Simulator (SCALE Sim). 

## Key Objectives:
- Quantize convolutional layer and feedforward layer
- Deployment
- Design space exploration
- Demonstrate the effective of our quantization method

## Technology Stack:
(List the hardware platform, software tools, language(s), etc. you plan to use)

Hardware platoform: Systolic CNN AcceLErator Simulator (SCALE Sim).

Software tools: Pytorch, Ubuntu, and SCALE Sim.

Language: Python, Shell.

## Expected Outcomes:
(Describe what you expect to deliver at the end of the project)

Successfully deploy the quantized Convolutional Neural Network on Open source platform SCALE Sim. Given a CNN layer, conduction design space exploration (DSE) for hardware archiecture parameters. Comparing the result and performance between with and without quantization, demonstrate the effective of our quantization and DSE mothod.
