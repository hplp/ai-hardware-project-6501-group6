Design Space Exploration for Compressed Deep Convolutional Neural Network on SCALE Sim

## Project Description:
(Provide a short description of the problem you're addressing)

Quantize Convolutional layer and feedforward layer into low-bit like int8, int4, and int2 and deploy it on the open source platform Systolic CNN AcceLErator Simulator (SCALE Sim). 

## Key Objectives:
- Quantize convolutional layer and feedforward layer
- Design space exploration
- Depoly the quantized model onto SCALE Sim with the optimal hardware configurations and show the effectiveness of our method

## Technology Stack:
(List the hardware platform, software tools, language(s), etc. you plan to use)

Hardware platoform: Systolic CNN AcceLErator Simulator (SCALE Sim).

Software tools: Pytorch, Ubuntu, and SCALE Sim.

Language: Python, Shell.

## Expected Outcomes:
(Describe what you expect to deliver at the end of the project)

Successfully deploy the quantized Convolutional Neural Network on Open source platform SCALE Sim. Given a CNN layer, we conduct design space exploration (DSE) to find the optimal hardware architecture configuration. We will compare the performance under different optimization methods and show the effectiveness of our quantization and DSE mothods.
